<p>phonology rough draft, essay format? Musical phonology is a phrase even google has trouble bringing in results for. One might find the recorded works of Leonard Bernstein among the few relevant results. One can occasionally hear this phenomenon in modern music, most recently I stumbled across Saul Williams, List of demands and reparations. His intent is made easier to connect to musical phonology when the melody changes from the hard synth to the singers voices mimicking the common bit of music taken from our language. (mp3sample)The mocking "wha wha wha wha" has found its way to all of us at one time or another. From now on listen for it, I suspect before long one will notice a co-worker or family member hitting those familiar notes with ease. Because of the familiarity of the tune we are attracted to it

<p></p><p></p>Nootropics for music
Could taking a seemingly harmless supplement improve your musical talents?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valproic_acid

anecdotal
*stacks refer to the entirety of your supplement consumption.

Nootropic user: "Anecdotal realization: I have a huge collection of music I listen to at work and I'm running out of stuff to keep me interested, and songs in general that I've always loved don't have the same effect on me. At the same time I get more excited than ever when I find a great new song. Anyone else in this boat?"

What's your stack look like?

Nootropic user2: Piracetam and noopept mainly

Nootropic user1: This is probably just how the brain works in general. Your brain simply craves novelty. I've noticed that music sounds a lot better on noots but the same stuff will get old eventually.

Nootropic user3: this may just be the normal ebb and flow of how the mind works

Nootropic user4This is just speculation, but the memory enhancement that comes from nootropics could make you habituate to them faster

 I feel like music induces euphoria in me more easily when taking my stack, but I become more familiar with my music and songs feel over played more quickly.

I feel the euphoria as well, normally I don't listen to music but on my stack I have a real appreciation for it.

skull
oh wow that is interesting. Less of evidence for hard wiring but rather accidental features providing predisposition. I wonder what kind of skull shape Pythagoras had

Purple Music. Purple dubstep, DnB, hip hop, Houston chopped & screwed, whatever - heck, purple jazz if you can find it. Blue music w/ a tinge of purple is fine too. (You'll know its color when you hear it.)
Joker talking about purple music: "I think that all music's got a colour, because it has."

<p>
Purple Music
Electronic music genre, evolved from dubstep, tells a story in approximately 2 minutes or less. Every 8 bars a new layer needs to be introduced with the intention of filling all frequencies with music layers until the final 8 bar chorus completely saturates the listener with sound. Track usually starts with the intended chord progression, adds beat, then bass line and so on until crescendo. Typically Purple tracks are written and played at 140 beats per minute. Purple Music should be able to have the beat removed and still remain interesting.

It seems I've been run out of their chat by not only what brings them to the purple music but what also makes everyone cops. The devils weed seems to be at the root of all this purple madness. Check off another genre on wouldn't exist if people were sober. All in all I find the purple music growing on me, I might just have to add a few tracks to my playlist.
