<p>phonology
rough draft, essay format?

Musical phonology is a phrase even google has trouble bringing in results for. One might find the recorded works of Leonard Bernstein among the few relevant results.

One can occasionally hear this phenomenon in modern music, most recently I stumbled across Saul Williams, List of demands and reparations. His intent is made easier to connect to musical phonology when the melody changes from the hard synth to the singers voices mimicking the common bit of music taken from our language. (mp3sample)The mocking "wha wha wha wha" has found its way to all of us at one time or another. From now on listen for it, I suspect before long one will notice a co-worker or family member hitting those familiar notes with ease. 

Because of the familiarity of the tune we are attracted to it

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
